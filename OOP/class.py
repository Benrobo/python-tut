"""
    Python Classes/Objects
    Python is an object oriented programming language.

    Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

    A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
"""

# Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:

class MyClass:
    x = 5
    
# Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:

name = MyClass()

print(name.x)
