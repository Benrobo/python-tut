    Python Operators
    Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

    In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

"""
    Python divides the operators in the following groups:

    Arithmetic operators
    Assignment operators
    Comparison operators
    Logical operators
    Identity operators
    Membership operators
    Bitwise operators

# Arithmetic Operators

a = 10
b = 20
c = 27

add = a+b
sub = a-b
mult = a*b
division = b/a
mod = b%a # returns the modulus or remainder when divided
expo = a**2 # returns the Exponentiation 10^2 
floordiv = c//a # floor division. it simply divides the number without decimal place

# print(f" 
#     {add} \n 
#     {sub} \n 
#     {mult} \n 
#     {division} \n 
#     {mod} \n 
#     {expo} \n 
#     {floordiv} 
# ")


# Assignment Operators

a += 10 # or a = a + 10
b = 100
c *= 2 # or c = c * 2
# a **= 2 # or a = a^2
a >>= 1

# print(a)

#  Logical Operators

# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

# AND :- Returns True if both statements are true otherwise returns false

# print( "name" == 23 and "name" == "name" )

# OR :- Returns True if one of the statements is true

# print( "name" == 23 or "name" == "name" )
