    Set
    
    Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

    Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

    A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.

    Sets are written with curly brackets.
    
    Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
"""

print("")

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# print(type(thisset)) # <class 'set'>


# Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.

"""
    Unchangeable
    
    Sets are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

    Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.
